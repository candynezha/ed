- Terrorism, human trafficking, poverty, crime, why does all this still happen to us? According to everystudent.com "The world is the way it is becasue its the world that we, in a sense, have asked for." It all starts way back when Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, we can say they set the course for us with their decisions even though God said not to, but we wanted to. This question is mostly used to accuse God to not be a loving God, or to make a statement that God is dead, but really, it is a problem that we should unite and solve together.

For others and Christians especially, trials are inevitable in the future and we cannot escape it in any way whatsoever. However, these trials build and test our faith in God and compassion for others. Everyone, even Jesus himself, has or will face challenges and obstacles life will throw at you.
