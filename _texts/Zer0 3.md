- According to bbc.co, on the topic of the Amish "The Amish believe that it's essential to keep themselves separate from the "world", so they live in their own small communities and differ from other Americans in their dress, language, work, travel, and education." It must be nice to live simplistically and in harmony with nature without technology but do Christians really need to separate themselves from Christianity? Not really, but the modern culture will definitely challenge one's faith in the Lord. Throughout the years, culture twists the teachings of the Bible to make it seem more comforting to the mindset of the human. Like birth control, for example. Before that cohabitation was seen as an unholy form of relationships, as that would tempt couples to have sex before marriage (laws even prohibited cohabitation). But when the birth control pill was introduced in the 1960s, years later, cohabitation was seen from difficult and unnatural to normal and convenient. Society there twisted what was frowned upon in scripture, which sticking with modern society as a Christian would be very difficult these days, but it is possible.
