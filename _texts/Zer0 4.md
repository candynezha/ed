- Many Christians think that they are going to heaven when they die, but there is no solid evidence yet saying that is the truth, so we cannot know for sure whether or not we are going to either of those places. We should just have faith and trust in God. If there is a God, then there are only two options available to us and going to heaven or hell is unavoidable in such situation. In the bible, John tells the readers that if you believe in the son of God that you will have eternal life (1 John 5:13). But he doesn't say anything about sin and the requirements to go to heaven. In Romans 6:23 Paul tells us that "The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" Meaning that sin separates us from God and gives us death, but believing in Christ makes him give us eternal life as a gift. In 1 John 1:9 It says "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So in conclusion, we cannot know for certain whether we will go to heaven or hell, but if we confess our sins we shall have eternal life, since sin separates us from God and gives us death.
