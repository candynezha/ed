-  DonecaThis is one of the biggest questions people come to Christians with. If God is such a loving God he will always forgive and not send anyone to hell, right? The Bible describes hell with verses such as Psalms 9:17:  “The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God.” and 2 Thessalonians 1:9: “They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might.”. Hell is basically like the last resort to God, as he gives us many chances to repent and forgive because he fervently loves us. It is not like he enjoys casting people to hell, but I don’t think He wants the wicked to step foot into Heaven. It is not only up to God that makes the decision if we should go to heaven, but it is up to the individual to make the decisions for the good of the person.

Integer convallis sollicitudin neque, a tempus massa vehicula non. Nulla tempus mi in nulla ultricies, vitae imperdiet erat interdum. Morbi sodales diam sed imperdiet accumsan.
