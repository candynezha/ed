-  Donecaa.This is one of the biggest questions people come to Christians with. If God is such a loving God, he will always forgive and not send anyone to hell, right? The Bible describes hell with verses such as Psalms 9:17:  “The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God.” and 2 Thessalonians 1:9: “They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might.”
