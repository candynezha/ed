  <h1>Describing and answering the big spiritual questions</h1>

<p> Answering all the questions to life is impossible. But even if it is impossible, we can try to answer some of them. Such as "Why does a bad God still send people to hell?" or "Why is there something rather than nothing if God doesn't exist?". The purpose for this project website is to answer some of those questions as best as possible with accuracy, and professionalism. <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Source</a> <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">Source2</a>
