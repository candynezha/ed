  <h1>Describing and answering the big spiritual questions that we care about</h1>

<p> Answering all the questions to life is impossible. But even if it is impossible, we can try to answer some of them. Such as " Why does a loving God still sends people to hell? " or " If there is a God, why do bad things still happen to people? ". The purpose for this project website is to answer some of those questions as best as possible with great accuracy, and professionalism.
